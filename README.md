# Introduction for Numerical Integration Codes 
This repository contains MATLAB algorithms created for the Mec 105 class at Colorado State University. This codes have the purpose to find roots of function, decompose matrices, and calculate numerical integrals of functions. The purpose of this class was to get familiarize with numerical methods and obtain an insight in how computers work.
